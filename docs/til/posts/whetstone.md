# Sharpening A Knife With A Whetstone

We have a nice set of knives given to us as a Christmas present some years ago, and a bunch of other pretty good knives from previous sets.  But many of them are just not sharp.

I have a metal rod-thing that I would use occasionally, but I don't think that was cutting it.  bada-bing.

So I ran across a virgin whetstone on a basement shelf that I [bought on amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055B2RGO/) a few years ago maybe thinking then I would learn how to use it, but never did.  Well that day has come.

I did some youtube-review on knife sharpening with a whetstone, and it was clear I would need a fixture to hold the whetstone while sharpening, so I made one from spare lumber.

I can clamp the whole fixture to a countertop and get to honing.  

I pretty much just freestyled it using [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGy4hWO_rTw).

I have sharper knives now.
